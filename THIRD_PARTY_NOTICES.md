## Modifications (Apache-2.0 §4(b) notice of changes)

The following components were modified from their upstream sources:

- **cloudflared** — added a proxy-aware edge dialer that routes the tunnel's edge
  connection through a SOCKS5/HTTP proxy read from the environment
  (`edgediscovery/dial.go`). This lets the tunnel operate on restricted networks.
- **zrok** — added a SOCKS5 proxy and DNS override path for Android / restricted
  networks, selected via the `ALL_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` environment
  variables (`cmd/zrok/main.go`).

## Source-derived work

- **Bangcle / white-box AES port** — derived from reverse-engineering work by
  [Niek/BYD-re](https://github.com/Niek/BYD-re) and
  [jkaberg/pyBYD](https://github.com/jkaberg/pyBYD).
